# spring boot and kotlin wedding :) testing crud operation using spring web(rest layer) and Spring Data Jpa with Kotlin


image::/images/spring_boot_kotlin.png?raw=true[Spring boot kotlin]


This is an example project trying to learn  Kotlin using Spring mvc and Spring data Jpa. When i finish the project i will
give my own opinion about this new language (for me is new because I am just reading how to write code with it) and how difficult is to learn kotlin if you are a java (it's my case)





. Use Spring data jpa H2 in memory Database
. Use mapping between layers using (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39199426/better-way-to-map-kotlin-data-objects-to-data-objects)
+
[source,kotlin]
----
    companion object {
        fun createFromUserModel(user: com.cromero.api.service.User) = User(
                id = user.id,
                name = user.name,
                age = user.age,
                favoriteNumber = user.favoriteNumber,
                color = Color.assignColorPerAge(user.age)
        )
    }
----
. Create integration test layer using mockmvc and rest template
. Test when "pattern matching" and Enum classes with static methods using companion object

+
[source,kotlin]
----
  // When expression is exhaustive, else is a must with integer value. It is better to use Enum or Sealed
        //classes instead if it would be possible because do not need else branch
        fun assignColorPerAge(age: Int) = when (age) {
            in Int.MIN_VALUE..0 -> BLACK
            in 1..10 -> BLUE
            in 20..40 -> GREEN
            in 40..99 -> RED
            in 100..Int.MAX_VALUE -> BLACK
            else -> BLACK
        }

  // Example of code using Enum. Else branch is not a must with enum and sealed class
  when (val color=createFromUserModel.color) {
                Color.BLACK->  "Your black color description is ${color.description}"
                Color.RED -> "Your red color description is ${color.description}"
                Color.GREEN -> "Your green color description is ${color.description}"
                Color.BLUE -> "Your blue color description is ${color.description}"
            }
----
. Test kotlin amazing null properties: using Safe Calls operator (?.) and the Elvis Operator (?:)
+
[source,kotlin]
----
userService.findByName(name)?.let { User.createFromUserModel(it) }?:
                            throw UserNotFoundException("user not found")
----
. Added A convenient and performant logging library wrapping slf4j with Kotlin extensions. https://github.com/MicroUtils/kotlin-logging
+
[source,kotlin]
----
private val LOGGER = KotlinLogging.logger {}
// using Kotlin's String templates: String literals may contain template expressions,
// i.e. pieces of code that are evaluated and whose results are concatenated into the string
LOGGER.info("User $savedEntity  was successfully created")
