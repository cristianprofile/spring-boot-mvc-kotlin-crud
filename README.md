# spring boot and kotlin wedding :) testing crud operation using spring web(rest layer) and Spring Data Jpa with Kotlin

![Spring boot kotlin](/images/spring_boot_kotlin.png?raw=true "Spring boot kotlin")





This is an example project trying to learn  Kotlin using Spring mvc and Spring data Jpa. When i finish the project i will
give my own opinion about this new language (for me is new because I am just reading how to write code with it) and how difficult is to learn kotlin if you are a java (it's my case)





- Use Spring data jpa H2 in memory Database
- Use mapping between layers using (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39199426/better-way-to-map-kotlin-data-objects-to-data-objects)
- Create integration test layer using mockmvc and rest template
- Test when "pattern matching" and Enum classes with static methods using companion object
